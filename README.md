I'm still learning wgpu with bevy, feel free to correct me xD.

## How to run it
<code>cargo run</code>  
It's quite possible that it will behave differently on your computer due to different gpu and fps, I'm not using FixedUpdate
and if you find it's stuck, just drag and move the window (i dont know why it could work either, but it's debug mode only issue, if you run it with --release it wont happen)

## Features
- arrow keys to move the camera (←↑↓→)
- LMB to put sands and RMB to remove
- mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- change brush size in the debug gui

## Thanks
thanks to all the people who have helped me, highly inspirated by okko's awesome tutorial, https://blog.okkohakola.com/SandFall/SandFallIntro
